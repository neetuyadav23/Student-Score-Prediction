# Student-Score-Prediction
A comprehensive machine learning project that predicts student final scores based on various academic and demographic factors. This project demonstrates fundamental ML concepts including data preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, and evaluation.
ðŸŽ“ Project Overview
This project uses a dataset of student performance to predict final grades (G3) based on various features like study time, family background, and previous grades. It's designed as a learning project to understand the complete ML pipeline.

ðŸŽ¯ Objective
Predict student final scores (0-20 scale) using:

Supervised Learning: Regression algorithms
Feature Engineering: Data preprocessing and transformation
Model Evaluation: Performance metrics and validation
Visualization: Data insights and model interpretation
